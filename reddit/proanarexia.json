It's not worth it to give these guys any pictures or information on you they can use against you. Any advice or help they can give u can get from someone else without compromising yourself.

{"_type": "snscrape.modules.reddit.Comment", "author": "hypomaniacmeg", "body": "No problem \ud83d\ude0a it really does work. Let me find the link for the specific workout that I used. Personally, I lose at least 5lb in the first week just from shedding the excess water weight. I dropped most of my weight in the first 2 months!  I'm telling you, it's the best I've ever felt in my life, because my lifestyle was so much healthier. I didn't even really consider myself Ana or anything. I was bordering it I guess, since my calorie intake was so low, but aside from that I just tried to always make healthy choices &amp; keep my portions small. Portion control is another important one. You don't want to eat a whole lot at once. If you're eating large portions, your stomach stretches &amp; becomes larger, leading to increased hunger in order to feel full. If you eat smaller portions more frequently throughout the day, your stomach shrinks, making it way easier to control hunger. It's hard in the beginning while you're getting used to it. You'll be dealing with hunger pains. But it won't last long if you can make it through. Also, if you're like me &amp; you intake a lot of caffeine daily, make sure you're getting enough coffee to avoid caffeine withdrawal headaches. Lol. They suck. Btw. I totally understand the depression. I've been in a very deep depression for months now, it's so hard to get started. I decided to take it slow. Started with stretching morning &amp; night, drinking more water every day, cutting out junk food. One thing that probably contributed to my feeling so well was the low sugar diet. Too much sugar will cause an endless list of issues with your health. When you're getting the proper amount of natural sugar &amp; no excess, it's great. Look up the benefits of it, also Intermittent fasting benefits. I'm about to reply with the link to the workout. It's designed for beginners &amp; to be non judgemental. You'll love this guy.

Fruit, yogurt, white meat chicken. Whole grains. No junk, very low carbs, no red meat, no sugary drinks, none of the obvious things. If you want to lose weight you have to stay in a calorie deficit. Burn more than you intake every day. Intermittent fasting is important too. Don't eat until 11am, stop eating at 7pm. No exceptions. Workout 20-30m per day as many day a week as you can. Beginners cardio real start video on YouTube is fine. If you have adhd, try go get meds for that, usually feom a psychiatrist. That'll stop your appetite. Aside from massively restricting your caloric intake, you really dont have to be that extreme to begin with. Calorie deficit, well hydrated, stay away from fattening foods/drinks, beginners cardio, Intermittent fasting. Youll get used to it. I lost over 50lb doing this. Started at 165, ended up around 115.

When I started my new 'weight loss lifestyle' I really thought I'd done something until I saw ED videos and realized my new 'lifestyle' was JUST ONE BIG ED \ud83d\ude25\n\nI never considered myself ugly despite being very very fat... but I have now started telling myself that because my past 'body positive' attitude was NOT helping me reach my dream figure and appearance! I have such a bubbly attitude and my personality just DOES NOT fit inside a fat body! How can I skip around, or cling onto friends, or hop onto beds when my fat self could flatten people and break furniture??? How can I wear pretty frilly dresses that sway around me as I walk-skip if I'm too fat to fit into the ugliest XXXL clothes??? \n\nSo I've decided. In order for me to be more me, I need to look like me. And what I look like right now is so so not ME! I have SO MUCH PRETTY POTENTIAL! I'm literally wasting God-given looks because I'm too damn lazy to achieve and maintain them! \ud83d\ude11 I've only become a little slimmer but I'm already feeling so much more happy and confident! Even my family and friends treat me better! I still can't wear clothes that aren't XL+ yet, but just feeling how baggy my old clothes are gives me such a hype \ud83e\udd7a\n\nI binge eat when stressed, upset, and depressed so stopping that took a whole lot of looking at myself in the mirror and telling myself not to ruin my body just because my brain and life are always trashy. I started off by eating keto... It didn't really help so I just started calculating calories instead! Gym didn't help either and I was just exhausted and self conscious there while also losing next to no weight at all!  Now I've figured out the BEST workout for me!  I download the coolest, savage-est, sexiest dance music with the most fun lyrics possible and dance-walk to the beat for about an hour a day! \n\nEven when I'm so so hungry, I just start dancing and then I feel better for a while... and then I just drink a whole lotta water and sleep while pacifying myself with promises of a good breakfast tomorrow \ud83d\ude1d I struggled with painful cramps all over my body due to physical exertion and my tummy just continuously was gassy and acidic... But I worked out a good warm up and warm down routine and the cramps gradually went away! Then I got myself a capsule for gastritis so I'm less worried about the burning in my stomach too! \n\nOMG I'm putting in so much effort towards sculpting this shapeless body into my dream figure... and the pure ecstasy I feel when I notice the slightest progress makes all the hunger and exhaustion worth it! So, if you're out there with the same goals as me, keep going! If none of the diet and workout tutorials online are working, throw them away and do whatever experiments till you figure out what works for YOU! I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK! IT'S WORTH IT! DON'T GIVE UP! DON'T LET THEM TRICK YOU INTO LOWERING YOUR BEAUTY STANDARDS FOR YOURSELF! YOU CAN DO IT! GO OUT THERE AND UNLEASH YOUR PRETTY/HOT POTENTIAL!!! IN THEIR JUDGEMENTAL FACES!!! \n\nAnd last but not least, remember that nothing- I repeat- NOTHING Tastes As Good As Weight Loss Feels! \ud83d\ude18\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc", "subreddit": "proanarexia", "title": "Hey Guys!
